Generating Makefile
-------------------
run `cmake-gui .` in project directory click on *Configure* if configuring was done right click on *Generate* button,
it will create linux like Makefile in base directory.



Doxygen documentation
---------------------

Running command `doxygen` in base directory will generate automatic documentation from code sources.

For correct caller/callie graphs generating you'll probably need to resolve `graphviz` dependency.
